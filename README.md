# Motivation For Tableau Dashboard:

the motivation for creating this dashboard is two fold, first this was my first kick of the can in creating a tableau dashboard so most of the graphs were made more to experiment with the tools and the different types of graphs rather than to tell a good story as most data analysis should. the motivation for the topic was that i enjoy markets and investing and as most people who invest know gold and other physical commodities is a good hedge against inflation, however i was curious how the asset did over the past few years and if it was worth it to add to my portfolio.

# Motivation For each graph:

## Graph 1: Price of Gold per month for the last 5 years

this graph is used to communicate the yearly change in price of gold per month. it was used to answer the question: is there a good time of year to invest in gold? this graph shows that 3 out of the last 5 years the price went up over the year perod so it is better to invest in the first half of the year.

## Graph 2: Annual % change (from previous year) by year

this graph is used to look at the difference year to year on gold, and displays the change in a percent from year to year. this chart is useful to understand the growth or lack of over the whole market of gold.
